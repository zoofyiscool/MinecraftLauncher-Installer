# MinecraftLauncher-Installer
### Installs an old version of the Minecraft Launcher.
Make sure you have `JRE` installed on your system.

```
Download the script

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoofyiscool/MinecraftLauncher-Installer/main/MC-Install.sh

Make it executable

$ chmod +x MC-Install.sh

Run it

$ ./MC-Install.sh
```

### Why have I made this? You might ask.
Currently in the latest version of the Minecraft Launcher your forced to sign in with a Microsoft account, which isn't good.

In the older launcher versions your free to sign in with a Mojang account.


### READ!!
The latest version that works is 1.18.2, 1.19 does NOT work.

Also in the edit profile dialog set your JVM Args to this -Xmx2G -Xmn256M
