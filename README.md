# MinecraftLauncher-Installer
### Installs an old version of the Minecraft Launcher.
Make sure you have `JRE` installed on your system.

```
Download the script

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoofyiscool/MinecraftLauncher-Installer/main/MC-Install.sh

Make it executable

$ chmod +x MC-Install.sh

Run it

$ ./MC-Install.sh
```

### Why have I made this? You might ask.
Currently in the latest version of the Minecraft Launcher your forced to sign in with a Microsoft account, which isn't good. In the older launcher versions your free to sign in with a Mojang account.
